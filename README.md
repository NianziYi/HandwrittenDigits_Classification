# HandwrittenDigits_Classification
This project uses SVD algorithm and two-stage algorithm to classify handwritten digits (The project_instruction.pdf shows more details).

## Part A
We used the training set to compute the SVD for each digit class (1-10), then we checked the classcification accuracy of each digit. 

## Part B
We used two-stage algorithm to classify digits, and compare the accuracy with the accuracy we got from SVD algorithm.
